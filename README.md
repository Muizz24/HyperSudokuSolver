Simple sudoku finding algorithm that uses DFS and backtracking to solve a hyper Sudoku grid in <0.1 seconds!

Requirements:
  -Python 3.0 or above
  -HyperSudoku grid that has only one solution
  -Pytest in order to run cases with python
  
How to Use:
  - Test.py contains all the test cases you can run in any python compiler while HyperSudoku.py holds the code that solves the algorithm.
  - Add your own test cases into Test.py and make sure the grid is a hyper Sudoku grid with only one solution.
